UnsubscribeDiscussion
=====================

Vanilla plugin: Adds the ability to selectively turn off notifications for individual discussions.

I found that the "Participated" notification preference (<i>Notify me when people comment on discussions I've participated in.</i>) would be ideal, if only you could unsubscribe from these annoying discussions that span over a hundred pages you are getting notified for, just because you commented once. 

This plugin solves that by adding the option to mute notifications from individual discussions.
